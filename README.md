# auto-prep

In the company that I worked at the time that I created this script, there was a metric using the hours that the members registered on Clockify every week. To calculate that metric, every week the project manager had to access Clockify and copy/paste data from Clockify to a sheet that would calculate the metric. This process takes almost 30 minutes every week to be finished.

With this application, all that job is reduced to a single click, which uses the Clockify API to extract all necessary data and leave it ready to copy/paste on a sheet.
